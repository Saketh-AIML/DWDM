# DWDM
DWDM- Data Warehouse and Data Mining

Overview
This project is focused on the development and analysis of a Data Warehouse and the application of Data Mining techniques. The objective is to efficiently store and manage large volumes of data and extract meaningful patterns and insights using various data mining algorithms.

Features
Data Warehouse Construction: Implementation of a scalable Data Warehouse designed for efficient data storage, retrieval, and analysis.
Data Mining: Application of various data mining techniques to extract patterns, correlations, and insights from large datasets.
ETL Process: Extraction, Transformation, and Loading of data into the Data Warehouse.
Visualization: Generation of reports and visualizations based on mined data.
